A power electronics library containing various power electronic topologies (diode-rectifier, buck converter, boost converter, flyback converter), user-interactive to ask for circuit parameters, and computes the output current and output voltage, and ripple inductor current, ripple capacitor voltage, and peak switch voltage/currents (for design choice).

A **diode rectifier** is a AC-to-DC power converter. Implements a inductive filter for cleaner and flatter DC output voltage.
A **buck converter** (step-down converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter which steps down voltage from its input (supply) to its output (load).
A **boost converter** (step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping down current) from its input (supply) to its output (load).
A **flyback (or buckâ€“boost) converter** is a type of DC-to-DC converter that has an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude.
To use, need to make sure you have Java programming environment. Download and unzip, then follow instructions in comments on the .java files.
